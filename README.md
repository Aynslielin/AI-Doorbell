# AI-Doorbell
Welcome to the AI-Doorbell wiki!

This is the AI-Doorbell wiki report. In these pages, we'll introduce our product. Please enjoy!

In order to produce an intelligence doorbell, we hope the doorbell can alert us that someone is outside the door, even recognize who he/she is. The ideal functions of the doorbell would be:
## 1.Face Detection:
To detect that is there anyone outside the door.

## 2.Face Recognizing:
To recognize who the people are. 

## 3.Recording Video and Capturing Images:
To record the video and capture the photos of the people who outside the door. Then we can save these images in case of emergencies

## 4.Line Notify
To send the videos and photos to our line notify to alert us.

## 2.Capture Image (transfer photo to Google Drive)
This function will capture images when the doorbell detects the faces outside the door.

## 3.Google Appscipts & Line notify (ifttt sent the photo from Google Drive to Line notify)
This function will transfer the images that the doorbell captured and send the photo to the Google Drive. And we use the ifttt to connect Google Drive and Line notify, then ifttt will make Line notify send the photo that the Drive recieved to our Line and show the image. So we can see who is outside the door.
